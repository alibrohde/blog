I'm obsessed with productivity tools, and one of my absolute favorites is [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/?utm_source=www.alirohde.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-single-raycast-feature-i-can-t-work-without). I'm not an investor, just a power user who relies on it all day. I keep meaning to write about all the features I love, but if I had to pick one, it'd be clipboard history. I use it dozens of times a day.

Clipboard history is simple: open Raycast, type a few letters, and every link, snippet, image, file, and fragment of text you've copied shows up in one clean, searchable list. You can grab recent items or search back through days or weeks. You can search across all items, or you can limit the search by type (eg text only, images only, links only, etc.). It also uses optical character recognition (OCR), so if you're looking for a screenshot of your flight home and search "United," Raycast will instantly surface that image.

It completely changes what copying something can do. Traditional copy-paste gives you one slot. Raycast turns that into an endless archive. You can store anything, scroll back through what you copied days or weeks ago, and reuse it instantly. A URL you always reach for. A snippet you keep inserting. A note you reference often. It's all there. And if you use LLMs, clipboard history is the fastest way to send text, images, or files straight into a chat.

If you want to go further, Raycast supports paste-and-keep-the-window-open, which lets you paste the last, second-to-last, third-to-last item in seconds. So if you're dropping multiple photos into a tweet or multiple links into a doc, you don't need to reopen the panel between each paste.

Using clipboard history doesn't just improve your existing workflows. It opens up new ones, because you know your simple copy action is capturing everything you might need. You stop worrying about losing something you copied ten minutes ago. You stop breaking focus to hunt down files. You stop recreating screenshots because the last one disappeared. It takes the most universal computer action—copy and paste—and turns it into something fast, searchable, and dependable.
