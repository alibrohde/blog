I&rsquo;m the Managing Partner at [Outset Capital](https://www.outsetcapital.com/),
a venture capital firm investing in AI, devtools, robotics, and future of work companies.
I&rsquo;m based in San Francisco.

We describe ourselves as "builders backing builders" &mdash; our team consists of
AI practitioners and YC founders who provide hands-on support from those who know
what you&rsquo;re going through.

## Investment Focus

At Outset, we write smaller checks rather than leading rounds, aiming to be the
most helpful investor per dollar. We&rsquo;re here to support founders, but we
never get in the way.

Some of our portfolio companies include [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com/),
[Datology AI](https://datologyai.com/), [Hedra](https://hedra.com/), and
[Physical Intelligence](https://physicalintelligence.company/).
